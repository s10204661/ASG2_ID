## Design process
This website aims to sell our bags at a cheap price.

For the process thinking for our website:

- As a product owner type, I want to entice more consumers , so I can generate more revenue.
- As a product owner type, I want the consumers to stay on the website longer , to view the products longer , they can do this by logging in.
- As a user type, I want to explore the shop, so i can decide to buy the products.
- As a user type, I want to add to cart, so I can check for the items that I have added , and to see the total cost.
- As a user type, I want to log into the site so I can check my products bought or any bonuses I can enjoy.
